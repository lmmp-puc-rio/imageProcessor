# Image Processor Tool

This project consists of a tkinter tool designed to assist in the image binarization process:

![App Image](src/images/image.png)

Once the correct image is selected, you can initiate the automatic binarization process, as depicted in the following image:

![App Image in the binarization process](src/example/readme_images/binarization_example_capsules_2.png)

Additionally, users can enhance the contrast of the original image to improve the binarization process by using the slide bar:

![App Image in the contrast process](src/example/readme_images/contrast_example_capsules_2.png)

Users have the flexibility to choose between automatic (**OTSU**, **TRIANGLE**) or manual threshold settings for image binarization.

### July 2023 -> 1.0.0-alpha - Prototype tool
Date: 2023/07/31

Description: First prototype of the binarization tool

Language Structure: Python


### Install process on Windows:

1) Check if the virtualenv packages is already installed in your system

**run**:
    
    pip show virtualenv

If not, please install:

**run**:

    pip install virtualenv


2) Create the virtual enviroment;

**run**:

    python -m virtualenv env


3) Activate the virtual env;

**run**:

    env/Scripts/activate

**OBS**: If the env is not being activated, it may be a problem with Execution Policy Settings. To fix it, you should try executing the following command as admin in Windows PowerShell:

**run**:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process



4) Install the requirements models;

**run**:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

5) Run the Image Processor Tool:

**run**:

    python .\view_image_processor.py

### To build the App on Windows and Linux

run:

    python .\setup.py build

### Application purpose 

* Help with the image binarization process
* Image pretreatments to highlight contours
